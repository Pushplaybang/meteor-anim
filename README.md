# Anim
Tiny animation utility to use with _uihooks

Anim wraps velocity, and provides a configurable convinence function for animating with `_uihooks` in meteor blaze templates._



## Install
Simple install the package via atmosphere

```sh
meteor add pushplaybang:anim
```



## Usage
First, create a new instance of anim:

```js
App.Ui.Animation = new Anim();
```

Then in an onRendered callback

```js
Template.topicList.onRendered(function() {
  var instance = this;
  instance.parent = this.find('.list');

  // add node animation via _uihooks
  instance.parent._uihooks = {
    insertElement: function (node, next) {
      App.Ui.Animation.animate({
        parent: instance.parent,
        node: node,
        next: next,
        duration: 650,
        mode: 'insert',
        custom: {
          opacity: [1, 0],
        }
      });
    },
  };
});
```

heres an example with the `removeElement` hook:

```js
removeElement: function(node) {
  App.Ui.Animation.animate({
    parent: instance.singleView,
    node: node,
    duration: 650,
    mode: 'remove',
    custom: {
      opacity: 0,
    }
  });
}
```



### Notes: 

* The mode options can be either `insert` or `remove`.
* custom animation should fit the syntax defined by [velocityjs](http://julian.com/research/velocity/)
* alternatively, a simple `fadein` or `fadeout` can be passed to an `animation` property in its place.
